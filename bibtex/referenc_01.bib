	Abstract = {Learning is becoming an urgent topic. Nations worry about the learning of their citizens, companies about the learning of their workers, schools about the learning of their students. But it is not always easy to think about how to foster learning in innovative ways. This book presents a framework for doing that, with a social theory of learning that is ground-breaking yet accessible, with profound implications not only for research, but also for all those who have to foster learning as part of their responsibilites at work, at home, at school.

@article{SydWin1998aa,
	Annote = {Interfirm networks are considered as a kind organization. The authors claim that economic approaches and network analytical modes are limited and limiting in the insights they can provide on the diversity of organizational forms, their stability (or otherwise), generative and deconstructive processes. They therefore propose that interfirm networks can be theorised using Structuration theory and praxis to analyse, explain and hypothesize about the diversity and mutability of organizational forms observed. 

Are interfirm networks (and strategic networks in particular) really considered as a kind of organizational form distinct from other kinds of organization? Within the field of organization science an area termed network analysis has gained popularity for the ontology of organizations, that is organizations as elements of the network (or nodes) connected to other nodes via transactions and exchange or communication. 

This approach lends itself to agency theoretic and transaction cost economic perspectives, to rationalise the existence of the network and account for the stability of the network. These theories impart interfirm networks with a sort of logic, but they fail to explain the diversity of forms which are observed in the field for interfirm and network organizations. They also make certain assumptions which may not always hold (often implicit which weakens their basis) and which in turn imply the use of certain unstated theories of organization and behaviour. For example; rationality of decision making, machine bureaucratic sub-organizations, economic maximizing behaviours, comparability of factors, monetization of qualities, organizations as boundary limited input/output systems . 

Is the interfirm network merely a convenient representation or has it reached a point at which it has achieved the status of a 'structure' or institution recognizable to the participants, regenerated or present in the process and actions of participation? To that I can only say 'perhaps', or qualify that the following arguments apply to cases where membership of the interfirm organization is clear and unambiguous. 

In applying Giddens' structuration theory to explaining the setting and arrangement of relations in the interfirm network organization Sydow and Windeler apply an approach which may illuminate how the interfirm network can establish and change over time. Unfortunately the do not illustrate this argument with the 'hard cases' in interfirm networks, they do not discuss the multiplicity of organizational arrangements observed in the field, nor do they extend their use of the term to accommodate the more nebulous concept of the supply chains and networks. 

The two cases discussed are presented we suppose because they represent archetypes of the interfirm network, but how novel a type of organization are MLP and Benetton? Benetton and MLP-Finanzdienstleistungen AG are presented as 'interfirm' because they are losely structured as a hub and spoke firm with asymmetrical resources available to parties in the hub and those at the rim. These organizations take the form of franchises or long term subcontractors centred on a primary firm (legal entity). The relationship is highly asymetrical with power attached to the central entity but at the same time considerable resources or powers accessible to those at the periphery. As an experiment in the application of ST to a specific poorly understood setting the authors provide a useful interpretation of ST to account for stability of enterprises they term 'interfirm' and the behaviour of participants in such networks. Indeed it may be an approach which could usefully inform those participants as they reflect on their own circumstances and actions, and consider future decisions and interactions with others in the networks with which they shape and act to sustain. The authors' application of ST to the conceptual development of an ST understanding of the case organizations is limited in scope, they don't go far enough I feel in describing how an ST study of these settings might illuminate and inform. For example there is little attention given to the necessity to attend to individual action and practice, and processes that people engage in which create, renew or reform those structures they conceive or which are produced through practices. I am critical of the synthesis of their 'effectiveness' model of ST in action in the context of the interfirm network or organization. This represents I think an unnecessary development which further complicates Gidden's explanation of the duality of structure (consisting of a tension and composite of signification, domination and legitimation). Network effectiveness is presented almost as an economic variable or personal sense attributable to participants at some level. Is 'network effectiveness' supposed then act as a 'market clearing' function or 'fitness factor' for the interfirm network, unifiying in some way the successes or failures at signification, domination and legitimation. I know the authors do not intend a numerical treatment (it would be impossible in any way to orchestrate meaningful measures for these qualities or structures in any event). I think they resort to this approach in an attempt to avoid Gidden's priveliging of the individual and their action, in presenting 'Network Effectiveness' the authors might appear to appeal to a new structure (perhaps analytical?) which could be used as an aggregate measure of the entire network (p274), this effectiveness arises as part of a network effect, perceivable by sub-firms and individuals although inevitably this is constructed (if it really occurs) in different ways with different resources and contexts. With a notion of 'effectiveness' comes the concept of fitness or 'viability and acceptability' (p274), and testing of the network firm by the participants or members, (e)ven if an interfirm network, such as Benetton or MLP, is without doubt strategically led by a hub firm, the power advantage of this firm within the network is anything but absolute and unassailable, i.e., its effectiveness remains subject to assessment by the other network firms. I don't know, is this lazy language is are firms (and sub-firms) written here as actors with agency? If the explanation is that this is how members understand it then great, but it is descriptively ambiguous I feel and they might attempt to be more precise as to who is doing the acting. 

A comment: The authors privelige the inner context of these firms, i.e. membership is clear, unambigous and focused on the internal life of the network. The interfirm network is the sum total of these apparently self-contained resources and arenas. Does their argument present too closely the arena of the interfirm and the internal boundaries implicit in central and peripheral structures? Does this analysis breakdown when individuals' membership of 'the entity' is more contingent, less certain and in all likelihood is a pluralist/multiple membership many structures and institutions. Critique the claim that the more sophisicated the organization of the network, especially with respect to evaluating practices, the less necessary a direct exercise of power becomes on the part of the hub firm in order to reproduce its strategic leadership. Is this then a general conclusion? How then should we understand sophisticated for this statement to stand (subtle, obscure, complex, transparent)? In not giving due consideration to how such arrangements unravel (see Latour and Kuhn) they neglect a potentially fuller understanding of the 'dynamics' of interfirm networks, which must surely look at the establishment, maintenance, entrenchment, and destruction or unravelling of the network. Certainly these dynamics must be present at all times even though the interfirm appears outwardly stable, solid and real. Too little consideration of this trivialises the use of ST here. n.b. argumentation is entangled with the data, awkward at times to tease out. 

Q: Do the authors employ Giddens' use of 'recursive' reasonably? I feel the weight of meaning (from programming and maths) comes down on the sense of infinite, when what I think the authors really intended is to convey 'continuously repeated and reinforcing which recreates afresh the knowledge of the interfirm (see Knowing as Displacing, Law, J. (2000) Organization, 7, 349-354.)},

By doing so, the paper elucidates the crucial role boundary spanners have in alleviating discontinuities across institutional boundaries. Furthermore, we untangle the temporal process which led to the successful formation of an innovative network, namely stabilising the network, initiating a cognitive shift towards a network strategy, and developing a supportive culture and practices.

Their analysis applies the classification according to a number of distinctions, how theory accommodates: time (static versus longitudinal), logical forumation (formulaic versus heuristic and conditional), mechanism (e.g. causation versus conditions of an environment), assumptions (mechanistic/SEM versus unpredictable or at best stocastic), elements (inputs/outputs versus situation and outcomes). Broadly they distinguish between theoretical assumptions surrounding agency. Agency may be assumed to be a system property termed imperative or a social process arising organicially through in an emerging process or interaction. Agency imperative theories are realist technological and organizational approaches termed variance models. Process theories address the potential for change and action through an uncertain process of emergence, in particular social sense or meaning making processes.

Electronic Customs, the transformation of paper-based trade documents to electronic ones, and the corresponding redesign of customs procedures, seems to be very promising approach to deal with this dilemma. However, while ICT is widely perceived as a key component of a solution, we argue in this paper that the complexity of the redesign of these electronic documents and procedures for international trade is far more problematic than traditional business process and network innovations. We identify key challenges facing the development and introduction of innovative eCustoms solutions and we outline conceptual and methodological approaches to address these challenges.

Purpose -- The purpose of this paper is to provide a conceptual analysis on value proposition tools to be used in future empirical research and in building managerial insight. The conceptual analysis focusses on a living lab framework and recent theoretical developments around the concept of value that are reflected in the context of three managerial tools for creating value propositions.
Design/methodology/approach -- Using abductive reasoning, the descriptions of the tools were analysed as cultural texts, as language-in-use in a social context.
Findings -- In the context of the living labs approach, the Value Proposition BuilderTM (VPB) seems to conflict with the ideas and premises of user-centric innovation processes. In the Value Proposition Canvas (VPC), the co-creation aspect is rather vague, as the enterprise and its offerings are presented as creators of value for the customer. Thus, this tool somewhat contradicts the living lab approach. The People Value Canvas (PVC) is aligned with the service-dominant logic and the premises of living labs. However, all three tools largely neglect a deeper acknowledgement of the role of the wider context, the service ecosystem, and the role of networked actors as resource integrators. Moreover, none of the tools explicitly point out the role of enterprises as intermediaries in constructing invitations for value co-creation.
Originality/value -- The paper contributes to the SDL and living labs literature by conceptual analysis on different value proposition tools; the VPBTM, the PVC, and the VPC which are relevant for academics as well as practitioners creating new understanding and insights on the connectedness of the living labs framework and SDL as well as their relationship to managerial tools. By identifying the absent elements of S-D logic from managerial value proposition tools, the paper contributes to current discussions by giving attention from scholars towards investigating managerial tools and by providing a new conceptual analysis for future empirical research. The critical analysis of the managerial tools contributes to managerial practice by emphasising the need to consciously evaluate the benefits and failures of tools for developing their organisations.
